I drove my saracen through your garden last night
Sing up the RA
I kicked your front door down around at midnight
Sing up the RA
Oh something's telling me boy you're avoiding me
And when I find you, you will go for your tea

Oh I've got a brand new shiny helmet and a pair of kinky boots
I've got a lovely new flak jacket and a lovely khaki suit
And when we go on night patrol we hold each others hands
We are the British army and we're here to take your land
